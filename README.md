The project involves applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The goal is to develop models that can classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). By analyzing text features and patterns within the messages, the project aims to improve the accuracy of spam detection, enhancing the ability to filter out unwanted messages and ensure better communication quality.
